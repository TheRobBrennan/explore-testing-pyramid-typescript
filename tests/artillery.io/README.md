# Welcome

Here is an example suite for load testing with [Artillery.IO](https://www.artillery.io/)

## What about leveraging existing tests?

Use the [artillery-engine-playwright](https://github.com/artilleryio/artillery-engine-playwright) to combine [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with [Artillery.IO](https://www.artillery.io/) to be able to launch a whole lot of real browsers to do full browser load testing.
