# Welcome

This project will explore methods of testing React web applications using:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests
- Load testing

We will start by creating a sample Next.js app with TypeScript to use as our foundation:

```sh
# Create a new app using npm or yarn
% npx create-next-app@latest --typescript apps/nextjs-with-typescript
% yarn create next-app --typescript apps/nextjs-with-typescript
```
