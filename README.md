# Welcome

This project will explore methods of testing React web applications using:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests
- Load testing

We will start by creating a sample Next.js app with TypeScript to use as our foundation:

```sh
# Create a new app using an example from create-next-app
# https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript-graphql
% npx create-next-app --example with-typescript-graphql apps/nextjs-with-typescript-graphql
```
